URLObject 2
===========

**URLObject** is a utility class for manipulating URLs. The latest incarnation of
this library builds upon the ideas of its predecessor, but aims for a clearer
API, focusing on proper method names over operator overrides. It's also being
developed from the ground up in a test-driven manner, and has full Sphinx
documentation.

If you're new to this library, take a look at the :doc:`quickstart
<quickstart>`. If you're just here for reference purposes, see the :doc:`API
documentation <api>`.

Installation
------------

Install using ``pip``. There are no dependencies, and the package is pure
Python, tested on CPythons v2.5â€“3.3.
